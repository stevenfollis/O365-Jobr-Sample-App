O365-Jobr-Sample-App
====================

This sample application was prepared for a conference presentation showcasing modern application development on the O365 platform.  It is by no means a polished or production ready application, but does demonstrate patterns for application development.

Jobr is a reimagining of the "Fab 40"'s Job Requisition template with modern approaches.

Components Used
---------------------
* AngularJS
* BreezeJS
* Bootstrap
* Animate.css
* Bing Maps API



There are plans to enhance, polish, clean, and extend into a provider hosted application as time permits, and as always please feel free to send pull requests. Thanks!
