          <Field Name="JobDescription">
            Forwards are the most celebrated players in the team because they are often the ones who score goals. Since there are many ways to score a goal, there are also many types of forwards.
            Accuracy, head ability, and ball control are the typical qualities of a forward. A forward does not have to as much work as the midfield or defense but he must be able to convert when his teammates give him the ball.
